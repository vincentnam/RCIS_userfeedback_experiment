"The dataset consists of two large-scale human mobility collections in major cities (Paris and New York City), built from public GPS trajectories retrieved from OpenStreetMap. Each trajectory is enriched with contextual layers (stops, trips, points of interest, inferred transport modes, weather data) and synthetic social media posts generated by a large language model (Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct). Data is provided in tabular (Pandas dataframes) and RDF (knowledge graph) formats to support semantic reasoning and FAIR principles. Anonymization: User IDs replaced with random unique numbers.",Semantically Enriched Mobility Dataset with Contextual and Social Dimensions,154365,17 years,Open
